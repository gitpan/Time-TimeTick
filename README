PURPOSE
-------

Time::Timetick provides a quick and convenient way of instrumenting a
program to find out how long it took to reach various points.  Just use
the module and call the timetick() function whenever you want to mark
the time at a point in your program.  When the program ends, a report
will be output giving the times at which each point was reached.
To find out more, either install the module and use the command:

        $ perldoc Time::TimeTick

or, if you haven't installed it yet, type:

        $ perldoc lib/Time/TimeTick.pm


INSTALLATION
------------

Use Module::Build:

        $ perl Build.PL
        $ ./Build
        $ ./Build test
        $ ./Build install

but if you happen to do it the old way:

        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install

well then, the magic of Module::Build will make it work anyway.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

Time::HiRes is highly desirable but not essential.  (There again,
if you don't have it, just what sort of a hick setup are you
running, anyway? :-)

It also helps to have IO::Capture::Stdout for testing, but is not
essential.
